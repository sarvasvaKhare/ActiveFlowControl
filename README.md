# ActiveFlowControl
Active flow control of a flow past Cylinder using DRL(Deep Reinforcement Learning)
# installation
1.download openfoam files from gitlab link:-https://gitlab.com/f20190752/open-and-close-active-control <br />
2.The exercises folder contains two folder openloop_control and drlfoam <br />
3.openloop_control contains two folders A2f6(OpenFoam simulation of a rotaing cylinder with frequency 6 and amplitude 2) and cylinder2d(flow past stationary cylinder)<br />
4.drlfoam folder conatins has two main folders one is drlfoam which contains all the drl functions applied to openfoam case and example has the openfoam case of rotating cylinder with the best policy determined by PPO method.<br />
